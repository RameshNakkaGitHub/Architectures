### Big Picture
[Big Data Landscape](http://mattturck.com/2016/02/01/big-data-landscape/) - Love the picture, interesting ....   

### Machine Learning
### Powerful Search Engines
* Elastic Search
* Solr
* [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack) (now called Elastic Stack) - combination of ElasticSearch with Logstash and Kibana - This provides a powerful platform for indexing, searching and analyzing data.

### Word on Big Data and Maching Learning
[ref](http://linkis.com/QP1K8)

Big data is capable of providing more than ever insights with proper tooling and models using specializing machine learning techniques.

Machine learning is ideally suited for complex and disparate data sources with a variety of variables and loads of data. 
The more data is fed to an ML system, the more it can learn, resulting in higher quality insights.

An 80 - 20 rule applies with Big Data insights, with 80 percent of the details come from the internal and transactional data. 
* Using big data is only viable for organizations that have matured in the data utilization curve. 
* Once the business intelligence bit and predictive analytics have been achieved, only then does it makes sense to move toward big data.
* Organizations need to prepare themselves with adequate knowledge resources and skilled data scientists who are adept at not only building statistical models, but also at using cutting-edge programming for applying machine learning.

Business experts need to first ask themselves these questions: 
* What use case will they apply big data on? 
* What insights do we need from the big data?

Premature application of big data techniques, either without requisite expertise or without the knowledge of the business case to be solved, will result in the waste of human and capital resources.
